### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

Lab 4, part-2 was one of my favorites because it was very satisfying to complete a mini playable game. The game was hilo, where player 1 enters a secret number, and player 2 tries to guess it. This lab helped me improve on not writing redundant code, and using if, else, and else-if statements. I was also beginning to get more comfortable with formatting during this lab.

* Lab 7

Lab 7, part-2 was very interesting to me because I felt like the code we were writing is something that could be very useful in real life situations. The purpose of lab 7 part-2 was that you could enter a day, time, and streetname, and the program would tell you if you parking was allowed during that day and time on the street. This lab helped me to get more comfortable with 'and' (&&) statements and 'or' (||) statements.

* Lab 11

Lab 11, both part-1 and part-2 were very challenging for me. This was the first lab that used classes. Since I had just learned about classes, I wasn't as familiar with them as I was with other things in previous labs, such as loops or if statements. However, I still really like this lab because I learned a lot from it.
